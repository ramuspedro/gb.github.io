                We have taken the liberty of creating a justification mail which will help you explain to your management why this is a good investment and why it makes sense for you to participate.

                Hi (BOSS)
            </p>
            <p>
                We know that justifying budgets for people development initiatives in our organization have become very stringent and showing returns has always been a challenge.
            </p>
            <p>
                I came across the 2 day ROI Program, which helps in equipping participants with the knowledge on how to measure ROI in training using the Phillips ROI Methodology.
            </p>
            <p>
                This program is so intense and hands on because I am expected to validate a current project from our organization as part of the workshop. Not only this, we will receive inputs from the ROI experts while implementing this methodology and show the returns from the project to the management.
            </p>
            <p>
                One of the key benefits to our organization is that we will be able to eliminate redundant programs and inefficient projects that don't add value to __________(organization's name) bottom line.
            </p>
            <p>
                This investment is sure to give us returns, and I am confident that this is a great opportunity to show the management where the money that we spend is going.
            </p>
            <p>
                I have all the details of the program, and look forward to discuss this with you.
            </p>
            <p>
                Regards
                <br/> (YOU)
