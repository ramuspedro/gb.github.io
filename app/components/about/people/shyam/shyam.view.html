                        <p class="main-text"> Shyam cofounded GreenBooks as one of the youngest entrepreneurs in the learning industry back in 2008. A learning & development advocate since his early career, Shyam formed the prototype vision of what GreenBooks would be and how learning design and learning evaluation can contribute to the customer’s business. Drawing inspiration from his Engineering and Design qualifications, Shyam has been driving GreenBooks’ journey since its inception. Witnessing business cycles early on in his career has provided him with unique insights into team nurturing, client acquisition and high-quality solution architecture. A skilled training facilitator himself, Shyam personally delivers GreenBooks’ flagship program on the ROI Methodology. He was certified by none other Dr. Jack Philips himself, the founder and proponent of the ROI Methodology. </p>
