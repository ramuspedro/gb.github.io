                        <p> Learning is the word that always stays in the mind of this young man. When he is not reading up on Brazilian politics, he spends his time doing online courses or working on a new app idea. Pedro studied computer engineering Federal University of Pará located in Belém and is very proud to have graduated from a college that's situated in the heart of the Amazonian region. </p>
                        <p class="division-paragraph"> Pedro is full of energy. A part of this energy he spends in sports, like ping-pong and soccer. Another part is for his personal and professional projects. During his lifetime, he has focused on Electronics and Telecommunication Engineering, which are his areas of interest, but none of them were what he is looking in life. </p>
